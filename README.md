**ARCHIVE**

This project will no longer continue, as its purpose of "getting used to c++" has been achieved. Full completion with my current schedule would likely take several months with limited additional things to teach me from it.

File organization in Visual Studio happens through filters, which do not translate as folders in github.

**AI/LLM DISCLAIMER:**

In the spirit of the challenges, I restricted myself on how exactly I could use it:

**UNRESTRICTED:**

- Logging.
- Parsing the input data.
- c++ questions (doublechecked on e.g. cppreference.com & stackoverflow).
- Fixing compilation & runtime errors (index out of range, invalid condition reached, other minor implementation errors). These aren't the type of issues where the algorithm is incorrect for the problem, but is broken altogether.
- Generating test cases. This will be the only time it will read the problem description.

**RESTRICTED:**

- Implementing an explicitly laid out version of an algorithm.

Example: write a stack algorithm, increment this variable on condition X, this is the end condition, branch on condition Y,...

**BANNED:**

- "fix" queries when the output is not correct.
- Giving it (a part of) the problem description to fix or implement.
- Writing code I don't understand. I won't commit anything to this repository I cannot explain.
